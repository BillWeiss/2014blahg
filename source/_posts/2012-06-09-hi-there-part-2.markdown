After a couple of false starts at using a GitHub page for Octopress, I decided I was spending more time messing with it than with the blog.  So, I nuked it and am using the rsync publish method (slightly modified as localrsync, as seen [in this commit](https://github.com/BillWeiss/blahg/commit/504edeb72e9a85979e99b6899c7b50f8cc4a222c)) to just run it locally.

Honestly, I like that better anyway.  The source is still [at GitHub](https://github.com/BillWeiss/blahg) in case you want to see what's under the hood.
