Hi there.  I'm Bill Weiss, a sysadmin and manager of admins.  You can find
me lots of places other than this page:

 * On [ServerFault as BillWeiss](http://serverfault.com/users/4117/bill-weiss)
 * At [Backstop Solutions Group](http://www.backstopsolutions.com/), my day job.  "bweiss" at that domain will get to me, as well as lots of administrative addresses
 * On [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-weiss/33/206/107)
 * On [Twitter as BillWeiss](http://twitter.com/BillWeiss/)
 * On [GitHub as BillWeiss](https://github.com/BillWeiss)
 * Via email lots of places, but preferably "bv" at the domain this blog is on
 * In Chicago, IL, where I live.  Sorry, no Google Maps link here :)

Things I'm interested in, and thus you might see written about here:

 * Systems and operations, especially the nascent "DevOps" world
 * Automation of the same
 * Management of the same, and the people who do them
 * Security of networks, systems, people... whatever

Non-computer things I'm interested in, which I might also write about:

 * Coffee -- I have an [AeroPress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) and a [Yama 5c syphon](http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/coffee-brewers/vacuum-brewers/yama-tabletop-brewer-with-stand-lamp.html) at home, and use a [Porlex hand grinder](http://www.sweetmarias.com/sweetmarias/porlex-tall-ceramic-hand-mill.html), mostly with [Intelligentsia](http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/) beans.
 * Cooking
 * Music
