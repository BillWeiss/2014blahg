Hi there.  I'm Bill Weiss, a sysadmin and manager of admins.  You can find
me lots of places other than this page:

 * On (ServerFault as BillWeiss)[http://serverfault.com/users/4117/bill-weiss]
 * On (LiveJournal as Houdini-CS)[http://houdini-cs.livejournal.com/]  --
   that's a personal blog, not a professional one
 * At (Backstop Solutions Group)[http://www.backstopsolutions.com/], my
   day job.  "bweiss" at that domain will get to me, as well as lots of
   administrative addresses
 * On (LinkedIn)[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-weiss/33/206/107]
 * Via email lots of places, but preferably "bv" at the domain this blog
   is on
 * In Chicago, IL, where I live.  Sorry, no Google Maps link here :)

Things I'm interested in, and thus you might see written about here:

 * Systems and operations, especially the nascent "DevOps" world
 * Automation of the same
 * Management of the same, and the people who do them
 * Security of networks, systems, people... whatever
